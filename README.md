Coupon Acceptance Predictive Modeling
This project analyzes driver behavior related to coupon redemption for bar and coffeehouse establishments to identify the most effective target demographics for focused marketing campaigns.

📊 Project Goal
The primary goal of this analysis was to determine which driver characteristics (age, occupation, and frequency of visits) yield the highest coupon acceptance rate, allowing for the creation of a high-ROI marketing hypothesis.

💾 Data Overview and Preprocessing
The initial dataset contained detailed information on driver behavior and coupon usage.

Data Handling Notes
Null Values: Columns identified as containing null values were imputed with default assumptions, typically an equivalent of 0 or a neutral category, to ensure dataset completeness for initial modeling.

Missing Data: A significant limitation was the complete absence of car details (make, model, year, etc.). While the assignment focuses on driver attributes, the missing vehicle data prevents analysis of vehicle-based predictive features.

🍺 Bar Coupon Acceptance Analysis
The core of the assignment focused on the bar coupon dataset. A deep dive into acceptance proportions highlighted a clear dependence on visit frequency.

Key Acceptance Metrics
The overall acceptance rate for bar coupons was 41%. However, targeted segments showed vastly different performance:

Driver Segment

Coupon Acceptance Rate

Implication

Overall Average

41%

Baseline effectiveness.

Drivers visiting >3 times/month

76%

Highest ROI segment.

Drivers visiting ≤3 times/month

37%

Low-priority segment.

Age>25 AND >1 time/month visitor

49%

Better than average, but not frequency-dominant.

NOT "kids" AND NOT "Farming, Fishing, Forestry" (Urban/Non-Manual)

47%

Marginally better than average.

more than 4  times/month visitor AND Age<30

54%

Strong performance, but still significantly less than the 76% high-frequency group.

Strategic Hypothesis
Based on the quantitative findings, the following marketing strategy is proposed to maximize redemption rates:

Hypothesis: Focus marketing efforts almost exclusively on drivers identified as high-frequency bar visitors (i.e., those going more than 3 times a month), further filtered by age above 25 years, and urban adults (excluding Farming, Fishing, and Forestry occupations). All other segments, while better than the average, do not offer the same potential return on investment as targeting the high-frequency group with the 76% acceptance rate.

☕ Initial Coffeehouse Coupon Findings (Future Work)
A preliminary look at coffeehouse coupon acceptance suggests a different set of driving factors.

Overall Acceptance: The coffeehouse coupon showed a higher overall acceptance rate of 49% (vs. 41% for the bar coupon).

Key Indicator: Initial analysis indicates that the coupon is particularly accepted by married persons.

Further modeling will be required to confirm the high-ROI segment for coffeehouse coupons, likely focusing on demographic (e.g., marital status) rather than just behavioral (e.g., frequency) factors.
